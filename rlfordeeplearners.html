                    Imagine that, its early morning and you are reading newspaper just dropped by delivery guy. Now while sipping a hot cup of tea, you get an idea. Why can't I organize the articles by cool ML Techinques? The Caffaine pumped man, goes online, collects all Newspaper articles and wants them to be grouped. Thats where LDA comes as a savior. In this case, a newspaper article is document (for LDA) and what we want to do is assign a topic to each of the document. For example 'Novak Djokovic' retiring comes under Sports section and 'Hillary vs Trump' comes under politics section.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    Before we dive into details of topic modelling, let us have a look at a few topics in probability. If we skip these topics, you will only know how to use topic modelling, but will miss out on the wisdom and beauty behind the curtains.

                    <h2 class="subheading">Categorical Distribution</h2>
                    <p align="justify"> Before reading this blog, make sure you understand Binomial Distribution. You can also refer to my previous blogs for the same. If you recall, <b>bi</b>nomial distribution was cascade of 'n' events, with each event having two outcomes possible. Hence multiple coin tossing example fits into the explaination of Binomial Distribution. But what if each event could have multiple outcomes? For example in dice you have 6 possible outcomes. Such distribution is  considered to be a part of <b>Catagori</b>cal Distribution.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    Let us look at some spooky mathematical equations, to describe this distribution. In case you feel sweating, you should know that its normal. Instead of finding probability of 3 heads out of 5 tosses, we will find probability of 2 ones,2 twos,1 six out of 5 dice rolls. You can see that the problem has become complicated(if you say so), because we need to consider count of multiple categories in the overall cascade of events unlike binomial where only 1 category of head was being observed(i.e 1 head of 5 tosses, 2 head of 5 tosses, etc).
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    Can you tell me how many dimensions will be required to plot categorical distribution? Answer would be right in front of you, if you have understood the previous para.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    Let us consider a scenario where there are n simultaneously occuring events. Each event has m catagories namely $[c_1,c_2,\cdots c_m]$ with probability $[p_1,p_2,\cdots p_m]$ respectively. Now our objective is to find the probability of category $c_1$ occuring $n_1$ times,$c_1$ occuring $n_2$ times, and so on. In other words $[c_1,c_2,\cdots c_m]$ occuring $[n_1,n_2,\cdots n_m]$. Here there two intuitive lemmas/observed constrains are as stated bellow :
                    $$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{i=m}n_i=n$$
                    $$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{i=m}p_i=1$$
                    This joint probability (which is our objective) is given by equation bellow :
                    $$p(n_1,n_2,\cdots c_m)=\cfrac{\Gamma(n_1+n_2 + \cdots n_m+1)}{\Gamma(n_1+1)\Gamma(n_2+1)\cdots \Gamma(n_m+1)}p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_m^{n_m}$$
                    where $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$ or in other words  $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 1$.
                    Wait a second. Does this equation look familiar? I know its too long, but doesn't it remind of some other equation ? Well . . . you guessed it right. It looks very similar to binomial distribution. If there are only two catagories. Here head occurs n1 times and tail occurs n-n1 times The equation becomes
                    $$p(n_1,n-n1)=\cfrac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(n_1+1)\Gamma(n-n_1+1)}p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n-n_1}$$
                    or simplifying it further it becomes
                    $$p((n_1)_H)= ^nC_{n_1} p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n-n_1}$$
                    Here $p((n_1)_H)$ is nothing but probability of getting $n_1$ heads out of n trials.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="subheading">Gambler's Dilemma</h2>
                    <div style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:24px;margin: 21px;color: #666666">
                        Its friday night at L.A. and Ace Rothstien is eyeing to win a game of coins by 80% chances of winning. Now the rules of game are that out of 3 coin tosses, if you get 3 heads (all heads), then you win. Ace has a lot of money to bet on. Hence he decides to swiftly replace the coins in casino and replace them with biased coins. These coins are sligtly heavy on one side, but the thing is that Ace doesn't want to take any chances. He makes sure that he has 80% chances of winning, not more, not less. Do you think he will get arrested? 
                    </div>
                    <p align="justify">
                    In the above problem, we are looking at modelling the probability of coin toss so as to win the game of coins. You need to sink in here, that we are not interested in finding the probability of finding 3 heads out of 5 coin tosses rather we are interested in changing the bias of the coin such that probability of 3 heads out of 5 coins is a particular number. This is called Beta Distribution.

                    Do you find anything common in the above equations describing Binomial and Beta Distribution ? Try to substitue $(\alpha,\beta)=(n_1+1,n_2+1)$ It will become almost look like Binomial Distribution. The only difference, if you observe is the constant multiplicative factor and that the p is replaced with x.
                    This is becaue we are now considering probability(x) as variable, while $(n_1,n_2)$ or number of heads as fixed.
                    </p>
                    Now why are we even studying beta and bernoulli distribution? This is because, we are interested in modelling the gamblers changes of winning 3 trial game, <b>based </b> on his chances of winning single tossing event. In other words we are modelling probability distribution with probability as a variable. Nerds can call it probability of a probability. We will revisit this idea later, but for now you can simply forget this heavy line.
                    <p align="justify">
                    This is the reason, we call Beta distribution as a <b>"conjugate prior"</b> of Binomial Distribution. And to answer Gambler's dilemma, we can see from the answer is right on the graph. When p becomes 0.91 his changes of winning are exactly 0.8. Hence he is very likely to be caught if inspected.

                    <div style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:24px;margin: 21px;color: #666666">
                        For any simulation game and you have a crutial task of simulating the terrain. Now lets say, I tell you, that terrain around  Bangalore in game, should change according to actual terrain.  This is often used in Virtual Reality Gaming. Let us restrict the problem to simulating people on the street who are walking. Now we can't show the actual position of people as we may leak personal data. So we show a simulated map very close to original. Let us say there are <b>n people in total</b> out of which <b> k people are walking </b>. Now this n and k keeps changing right? So how do we design a good simulator?  
                    </div>
                    <p align="justify"><b>Solution A</b></p>
                    <p align="justify">Simplest approach is dividing k by n (p=k/n) and use it as probability of people walking.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><b>Solution B : More realistic</b></p>
                    <p align="justify">We don't want to have a constant probability(k/n) for simulation. But we want to sample the probability itself appropriately. That's where we use the buddy of binomial, its "conjugate" prior rather than "actual" prior. That is Beta Distribution. Prior means the know probability of an event. In Bayesian terms we write this as bellow</p>
                    $$P(label|data)\propto P(data)*P(data|label)$$
                    <p align="justify"> or in ther words</p>
                    $$posterior\propto prior*(prior\hspace{0.5 cm}likelihood)$$
                     But now by the conjugate prior what we are doing is something like this
                    $$conjugate\hspace{0.5 cm}prior \sim \beta (prior\hspace{0.5 cm}likelihood)$$
                     </p>
                     $\sim$ means "sampled from". It means that we are sampling probability value from Beta distribution of Original Prior likelyhood. And use this value instead of (k/n) for generating "walking people" in terrain.
